        <p>The animation loop is the loop that make each &quot;frame&quot; happen, i.e. whatever happend
every 30 to 60 times (or, indeed, &quot;frames&quot;) per second - which is the following:
<em> the next frame is scheduled
</em> the current program (i.e. a draw() Function is run).
  Note that this might not be the very latest
  content of the editor, because that might be syntactically incorrect. Also it might
  not be the last syntactically correct program, because that might have thrown
  runtime errors (for example used an undefined variable or function). The current
  draw() function is rather both syntactically correct and &quot;stable&quot;. Stability of a
  program cannot be guaranteed, but LiveCodeLab heuristically considers as &quot;stable&quot; a
  program that was able to run without throwing errors for the past 5 frames.
<em> the background is repainted if it has changed from the previous frame
</em> the new 3d scene is painted
<em> the stats widget on the top right is updated to show milliseconds taken by each loop
  frame.
#
Note that the followings are NOT done as part of the animation loop
</em> Syntax checking of the program typed by the user (that&#39;s checked only when it changed)
<em> sound playing. That happens by its own series of timeouts (as defined by the
  optional &quot;bpm&quot; command) separately from the
  animation loop.
</em> blinking of the cursor
